        <p>
          I&apos;m a recent graduate from Shiv Nadar University and a passionate
          software engineer with strong foundations in data structures,
          algorithms and databases. I have hands-on experience working with
          technologies including Next.js, React for the frontend, and Python,
          FastAPI, Django, Node.js, Nest.js and .NET for the backend. I am
          always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies, constantly
          looking for opportunities to grow as a full-stack developer.
